Scaffold the project foundation: license, copyright headers, package manifest, README with badges, CHANGELOG, and .gitignore. This is a one-time scaffolding step after planning is complete, using decisions made in the concept, features, tech-spec, and stories documents.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, the developer must provide (or the LLM must ask for):

1. **Project name** -- the repository and package name
2. **Copyright holder** -- individual or organization name
3. **License preference** -- e.g. Apache-2.0, MIT, MPL-2.0, GPL-3.0

## Steps

### 1. License

1. If a `LICENSE` file exists in the project root, read it and identify the license.
2. If no `LICENSE` file exists, create one based on the developer's preference.
3. Record the license identifier (SPDX format, e.g. `Apache-2.0`) -- this will be used in `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent) and in file headers.

### 2. Copyright and License Header

Establish the standard copyright and license header for all source files in the project. The header format depends on the license and the file's comment syntax.

**Example for Apache-2.0 in a Python file:**

```python
# Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holder>
#
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at
#
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
#
# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.
```

**Example for MIT in a Python file:**

```python
# Copyright (c) <year> <copyright holder>
#
# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
# of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
# in the Software without restriction. See the LICENSE file for details.
```

Adapt the comment syntax for the file type (`#` for Python/Shell, `//` for JS/TS/Go, `<!-- -->` for HTML/XML, etc.).

### 3. Package Manifest

Create the project's package manifest (e.g. `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`):

- The `license` field must match the `LICENSE` file (use the SPDX identifier).
- Include the copyright holder in the authors/maintainers field.
- Set the initial version to `0.1.0`.
- Add a placeholder description (will be refined in `document_brand` mode).

### 4. README.md

Create an initial `README.md` with:

- Project name as heading
- One-line description placeholder
- License badge (always include)
- Installation section placeholder
- Usage section placeholder

**Badge reference:**

| Badge | When to include | Example source |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **License** | Always | `shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg` |
| **CI status** | After CI is configured | GitHub Actions badge URL |
| **Package version** | After publishing to registry | `shields.io/pypi/v/...` |
| **Language version** | After specifying in manifest | `shields.io/pypi/pyversions/...` |
| **Coverage** | After coverage service is configured | Codecov/Coveralls badge URL |

Add badges proactively as each becomes applicable.

### 5. CHANGELOG.md

Create `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit as the version bump
- Use standard categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Omit empty categories
- Most recent versions at the top

### 6. .gitignore

Create or update `.gitignore` with language-appropriate patterns. Include at minimum:

- Build artifacts
- Virtual environment directories
- IDE/editor files
- OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- Test/coverage output

### 7. Mark Story A.a Done

Read `docs/specs/stories.md` and locate Story A.a.

- If Story A.a is found and represents project scaffolding: mark all its tasks `[x]` and change its status suffix from `[Planned]` to `[Done]`.
- If Story A.a is not found or does not appear to be a scaffolding story: warn the developer ("Story A.a not found or does not match expected scaffolding content — skipping story update") and continue.

### 8. Project Essentials: Verify or Create, then Memory Review

**8a. Verify or create `project-essentials.md` with concrete file headers.**

Check whether `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` exists:

- **If it does NOT exist**: create it from the artifact template at `docs/project-guide/templates/artifacts/project-essentials.md` (installed by `project-guide init`; refreshed by `project-guide update`). The **File header conventions** section is mandatory baseline content — substitute `<YEAR>`, `<OWNER>`, and `<LICENSE>` with the concrete values gathered in steps 1–3 above (the SPDX identifier from step 1, the copyright holder from the prerequisites, and the current year). Remove the trailing TODO note. Do **not** ask the developer whether to include the headers.
- **If it exists**: read the **File header conventions** section. If it still contains `<YEAR>`, `<OWNER>`, or `<LICENSE>` placeholders (or a trailing TODO note), substitute the concrete values from steps 1–3 and remove the TODO note. If the section is already concrete, leave it alone.

**8b. Memory review (append additional project-specific facts).**

Read your recorded memories for this project (e.g., `.claude/projects/<project-path>/memory/` for Claude Code users).

For each memory, evaluate: is this fact **project-specific** (belongs permanently in `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`) rather than — or in addition to — being stored in LLM memory?

Present candidates to the developer:

> "I found N memories. These may belong in `project-essentials.md`: [list with one-line summaries]. Which (if any) should I copy across?"

Await confirmation, then append confirmed items to `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` following the heading convention (`###` subsections, no top-level `#`). If the memory store is empty or inaccessible, note this briefly and continue.

### 9. Present for Approval

Present the scaffolded project to the developer for review:

- [ ] LICENSE file present and correct
- [ ] Copyright header format established
- [ ] Package manifest created with correct metadata
- [ ] README.md with license badge
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md initialized
- [ ] .gitignore configured

Once approved, proceed to coding:

```bash
project-guide mode {{ next_mode }}
```

{% include "modes/_header-sequence.md" %}
