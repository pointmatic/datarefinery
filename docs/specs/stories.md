# stories.md -- datarefinery (python)

This document breaks the `datarefinery` project into an ordered sequence of small, independently completable stories grouped into phases. Each story has a checklist of concrete tasks. Stories are organized by phase and reference modules defined in `tech-spec.md`.

Put **`vX.Y.Z` in the story title only when that story ships the package version bump** for that release. Doc-only or polish stories **omit the version from the title** (they share the release with the preceding code story, or use your project’s doc-release policy). **One semver bump per owning story** — extra tasks on the *same* story share that bump; see `project-essentials.md`. Semantic versioning applies to the package. Stories are marked with `[Planned]` initially and changed to `[Done]` when completed.

For a high-level concept (why), see [`concept.md`](concept.md). For requirements and behavior (what), see [`features.md`](features.md). For implementation details (how), see [`tech-spec.md`](tech-spec.md). For project-specific must-know facts, see [`project-essentials.md`](project-essentials.md) (`plan_phase` appends new facts per phase). For the workflow steps tailored to the current mode (cycle steps, approval gates, conventions), see [`docs/project-guide/go.md`](../project-guide/go.md) — re-read it whenever the mode changes or after context compaction.

## Version Cadence

Standard semantic versioning, with these conventions:

- **Every story belongs to a phase.** Bugfix stories included. No orphan stories.
- **Per-story bumping** (when a story owns its own release):
  - Bugfix or trivial change → **patch** (`vX.Y.Z+1`)
  - Feature or improvement → **minor** (`vX.Y+1.0`)
  - Breaking change → **major** (`vX+1.0.0`). Post-1.0 only, and only via the `plan_production_phase` mode, which negotiates with the developer about whether the breakage is substantively user-facing or technically-but-trivially breaking (example: a log-format change is technically breaking, but if logs aren't a core consumer capability, the developer may judge it minor or even patch).
- **Phase-bundling option:** a phase can run unversioned during work and ship a single release/tag at end-of-phase. Stories within the phase carry no version in their title; the phase's last story owns the bump (magnitude determined by the highest-impact change in the bundle).
- **No out-of-order implementation.** Story order in this file is the order of execution. If work order needs to change, **reorganize/renumber here first** — don't skip ahead and create version-number gaps.
- **Pre-1.0:** standard semver applies; version starts at `v0.1.0` (Story A.a).
- **Post-1.0:** every phase must go through `plan_production_phase` (the lighter `plan_phase` is pre-1.0 only). Major bumps only happen through that mode's negotiation step.

This is the authoritative cadence rule. **Do not extrapolate the bump magnitude from `pyproject.toml`'s current version** — re-read this section whenever you're about to assign a version to a story.

## Phase K: Data Ingestion Improvements, Bugfixes

---

### Story K.a: Refactor README.md (v0.22.0/v0.23.0 catch-up — audio plugin, segmented identity) [Done]

Documentation-only refactor bringing the repo-root `README.md` current with the
Phase-J releases. No version bump — pure doc catch-up (the features already
shipped in v0.22.0 / v0.23.0); rides the next code-story release per Version
Cadence.

- [x] Announce `audio_classification` as a second fully-real plugin (intro, "Why", Plugin model): `audio_folder` / `audio_flat` sources + required `target_sample_rate`, `window` Generation op, `log_mel_spectrogram` + fit-on-train `audio_normalize` Featurizations
- [x] Add the `[audio]` extra (librosa) to Installation; add an audio recipe example to Quickstart
- [x] Bump recipe anatomy `schema_version: 1` → `3`
- [x] Rewrite cache-identity prose: flat hash → four-segment identity (`core` / `plugin` / `overlays` / `extensions`) + per-segment scoped invalidation
- [x] `variants` → `overlays` (recipe anatomy block, section-roles table, `--variant` → repeatable `--overlay`); document the `extensions` namespace
- [x] Fix instance layout: `recipe.yaml` → `recipe.json`; correct the validate-check count (23 → 29)
- [x] Add the `Sinks` recipe section (section-roles table + brief example) and the `export` CLI verb

## Future

<!--
This section captures items intentionally deferred from the active phases above:
- Stories not yet planned in detail
- Phases beyond the current scope
- Project-level out-of-scope items
The `archive_stories` mode preserves this section verbatim when archiving stories.md.
-->

- **Image plugin tasks beyond classification** (detection, segmentation) — accommodated by the plugin interface, no v1 implementation per concept.md/features.md.
- **Tabular plugin: full operation implementations** — v1 ships a stub only; full implementation is post-v1.
- **Text plugin: full operation implementations** — v1 ships a stub only; full implementation is post-v1.
- **Recipe inheritance and multi-file composition** — variants suffice for v1; deferred per concept.md non-goals.
- **Resume-from-stage during materialization** — atomic temp-then-promote is the v1 failure model; resume support is post-v1.
- **`init` for non-image categories** — deterministic scaffolder is image-only in v1.
- **Inter-run concurrency: file-lock-based protocol** — pre-production serializes externally; the post-production protocol designed-for in cache layout is implemented post-v1.
- **Cache layout migration tooling (`clean --upgrade`)** — post-production cache-layout versioning + migration guide; v1 documents pre-prod invalidation semantics only.
- **Hard performance targets and benchmarking suite** — v1 is reactive; stories set targets when representative workloads expose problems.
- **Native Windows first-class support** — WSL2 is the recommended Windows path in v1.
- **Plugin sandboxing** — plugins run in-process, unsandboxed in v1; sandboxing is a post-v1 trust-boundary upgrade.
- **Image-classification plugin: additional capabilities deferred from Phase H sub-bundle** — see [`phase-h-datarefinery-feature-recommendation.md`](phase-h-datarefinery-feature-recommendation.md) for full specifications:
  - FR-ARCH-1 tight coupling — sibling `recipe_hash` participating in the current recipe's cache identity, so re-materializing upstream auto-invalidates downstream. The Phase H sub-bundle shipped FR-TRANS-1 with loose coupling; tight coupling is the follow-up needed for multi-team or longitudinal workflows.
  - Generic record-tagging primitive — factor FR-FILTER-1's bespoke `label` / `exclude_already_labeled` params into a shared mechanism multiple filter ops can use.
- **`stats_from_instance.variant: <name>` selector** — let a consumer recipe pin a specific sibling-variant's fitted statistics (e.g., normalize stats fit under a specific experimental overlay). The Phase I G19 fix closes the no-variant case; the variant-selector form is a follow-up. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Real `to_grayscale` Transformation op** — Phase I removed the declared-but-unimplemented `to_grayscale` OperationSpec entry to keep the surface honest. A real implementation with a `method: average | luminance | …` parameter set is deferred until a recipe surfaces a concrete need. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Plugin-pluggable validator-check reserved-set hook** — let plugins declare `Plugin.loader_stamped_fields(recipe) -> set[str]` so validator check 23 (Featurization `output_field` collision) can be applied to non-stub plugins when their loaders ship. Today the reserved-set is hardcoded for `image_classification`; tabular and text stubs don't stamp fields and don't need the hook yet. Originally noted in Story I.c's prevention notes; added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Per-stage report subsections** — extend the snapshot-based stage-aware viz dispatch (Story I.v / G7) so the rendered `report.md` carries one heading per snapshotted stage. The v1 deliverable is one report section with per-viz `stage:` annotations; richer structure is a UX polish follow-up. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Scaffolder v2 grand sweep** — refresh the bundled `init` scaffolder ([`scaffolder/init.py`](../../src/datarefinery/scaffolder/init.py)) to actively showcase v2 affordances in the scaffolded recipe (`seed_derive_from: master` on every seeded op, tag-driven `applies_to` example, `replace_input_records: true` demo, `value_in_set` instead of bare enum lists, etc.). Phase I's Bundle 4 ships the *minimal* scaffolder update (emit valid v2-shape recipes); the grand-sweep redesign of the scaffolded recipe as a teaching artifact is a follow-up. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Real `distributional` assertion kind** — replace the v1 placeholder with a real evaluator (KS test, JS divergence, or similar). The current placeholder always passes; downstream drift tools (DataMachine) implement their own checks. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **DR-side `class_balance` resampling** — physically resample (oversample minority records into the cached train split, or emit per-record `class_weight`) at the Splits stage rather than passing the strategy through as an MF-binding hint. Phase I chose MF-side resampling (Story I.s / G10); revisit if downstream evidence accumulates that the materialized instance needs to be framework-agnostic and self-contained. Added during Phase I planning (Story I.h).
- **Broad consumer-context rewrite of internal specs** — sanitize the deeper consumer-perspective surface in [`phase-i-dependency-gaps-v0.16.0.md`](phase-i-dependency-gaps-v0.16.0.md) and [`phase-i-intermediate-artifact-persistence-spec.md`](phase-i-intermediate-artifact-persistence-spec.md): replace "Recipe A" / "Recipe B" with generic role names, drop or rephrase Module N / Phase B / Phase D / Task 2 references, replace consumer recipe filenames (`cifar10-base.yaml`, `cifar10c-eval.yaml`) and consumer-side phase-plan links with generic placeholders, generalize consumer-specific record counts and tag names. Story I.h scrubbed only the hard-blacklisted course identifiers (see developer auto-memory) for in-course blast-radius reduction; this Future story is the deliberate rewrite once the course is complete. Git history will continue to carry the original consumer surface regardless. Added during Story I.h execution.
